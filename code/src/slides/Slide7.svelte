    <h1>WHAT DOES THIS TELL US?</h1>
    <p>
        The main takeaway from this analysis is that the
        impacts of siting a by-right multifamily district vary significantly between municipalities and stations
        within the same municipality.
        <br>
        We can also see that the population living near Rapid Transit stops are
        much more likely to take transit to work than those living near the commuter tail. This has implications
        for the MBTA Communities Act because it speaks to the differences in behavioral patterns of residents
        living near different communities.
        <br>
        <br>
        And how is the situation in other municipalities or for other stations?
